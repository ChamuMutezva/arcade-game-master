# Arcade Frogger game

The arcade frogger game is an exciting game to prove your exceptional maneuvering skills. The
aim of the game is to move the player from grass area into the water(blue area). The player
is moved by the use of the arrows of the keyboard. Along the way , the player must avoid being 
in contact with the enemies moving on the screen. If the player is hit , he is moved back to the
starting position and penalised by 5 points unless the player has no points at all. For reaching the
water , the player is awarded 10 points. If the player reaches 50 points , he moves to Level 2 
and when the player reaches 100 points , he moves to level 3. Level 3 is the maximum at the moment.
